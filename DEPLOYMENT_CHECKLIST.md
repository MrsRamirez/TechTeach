# üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Security Check
- [x] No API keys or secrets in code
- [x] Password protection with obfuscation (Base64 encoded)
- [x] Time-based access restrictions (school hours only)
- [x] Progressive delay on failed attempts
- [x] Session timeout (30 minutes for teacher tools)
- [x] Browser fingerprinting for additional verification
- [x] Activity logging and monitoring
- [x] Developer tools detection and warnings
- [x] Right-click and keyboard shortcut restrictions
- [x] Console message filtering to hide sensitive data
- [x] All external resources use HTTPS
- [x] .gitignore covers sensitive files
- [x] No server-side dependencies

## ‚úÖ Performance Optimization
- [x] Static files only
- [x] CDN resources for libraries
- [x] Lazy loading implemented
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Clean file structure

## ‚úÖ GitHub Pages Setup
1. **Repository Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
2. **Source**: Deploy from branch `main`
3. **Folder**: `/` (root)
4. **Custom domain** (optional): Add your domain
5. **Enforce HTTPS**: ‚úÖ (recommended)

## üìù Final Steps
1. Push all changes to main branch
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment
4. Test site at: `https://[username].github.io/TechTeach`

## üîó Entry Points After Deployment
- **Landing Page**: `/index.html` (or just `/`)
- **Lesson Selector**: `/LPS-github.html`
- **Teacher Tools**: Accessible via password through main site

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security Features for Student Deterrence
- **Multi-layer password obfuscation**: Base64 + reversal + Base64 encoding
- **Time-based restrictions**: Access only during school hours (Mon-Fri, 6 AM - 8 PM)
- **Progressive delays**: Failed attempts result in increasing delays (up to 10 seconds)
- **Session management**: 30-minute auto-expiration for teacher tools
- **Activity monitoring**: Tracks suspicious behavior patterns
- **Developer tools detection**: Warns against and logs dev tool usage
- **Right-click protection**: Disabled context menu with educational messages
- **Keyboard shortcut blocking**: Prevents common inspection shortcuts
- **Console filtering**: Hides sensitive information from console output
- **Attempt limiting**: Temporary lockouts after multiple failed attempts
- **Browser fingerprinting**: Basic device identification for access logging

## üéØ Security Philosophy
- **Deterrent-focused**: Makes casual snooping difficult without being fortress-like
- **Educational approach**: Security messages educate rather than intimidate
- **Proportional response**: Escalating security measures based on behavior
- **Teacher-friendly**: Easy for authorized users, difficult for curious students
- **Transparent logging**: All security events are logged for review

## üö® Security Notes for Teachers
- Password: `TechTeach2008!?` (obfuscated in code as `VmRXVmtGVU9EMUJNaFRVWldKaFZnM0Q=`)
- Access restricted to school days and hours
- Failed attempts trigger progressive delays
- All access attempts are logged locally
- Session expires automatically after 30 minutes
- Developer tools usage is detected and logged

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Considerations
- **Client-side only**: All security is client-side and can be bypassed by determined users
- **Educational appropriate**: Designed for classroom setting, not enterprise security
- **Deterrent effect**: Primary goal is to discourage casual exploration
- **Local logging only**: Security logs stored locally (not sent to server)
- **GitHub Pages compatible**: All security features work on static hosting

## ‚úÖ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!
